These repo was created to analyse the data from the whole bunch of FIFA 19 players, including soccer skills and attributes that probably could show us what a real person needs to be a good soccer player.

Then you can go to this url: "http://localhost:8888/tree" with your browser and enter to the "Fifa players analysis.ipynb" file
